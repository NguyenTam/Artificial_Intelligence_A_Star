# Artificial Intelligence: A Star

A-star is a pathfinding algorithm, which navigate toward the goal.
The goal is the green square and the robot is the red ball.
There are two visions: full vision and robot's vision.

This essential algorithm is virtually in most computers/smartphones.

This project was done in a well collaborated group: Nguyen Tam, Johansson Alex, Dutruit Jérémie and Stenroth Johan.

My main contribution is the A-star implementation.
